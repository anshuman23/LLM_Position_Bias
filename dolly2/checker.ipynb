      "Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are both nuclear reactions. Nuclear reactions are what happen inside of atoms. Nuclear fission happens when a uranium or plutonium atom splits in two, and releases energy and particles. Nuclear fusion is what happens when two atoms join together, and release energy and particles. The big difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion is that nuclear fusion releases more energy, and happens more easily. Nuclear fusion can take place in a nuclear reactor, which contains lots of atoms of the fissile element that undergoes fusion, and ensures a lot of particles are being released. Nuclear fission must take place in a nuclear reactor, but can also take place in a nuclear bomb, or even by simply hitting a heavy metal plate with a hammer. However, nuclear fission has to take place in a very high-energy environment, whereas nuclear fusion can take place under normal conditions.\n"

      "Despite improvements made by the Welsh Government to prevent people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence, the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate has not worked as well as it should have. As a result, there are still many people losing their homes while they are in prison. The key to this problem lies in providing more one-bedroom flats, which can house more people at a lower cost than keeping them in a rented flat, which would help lower the need for people to rough it outside before they are found suitable accommodation.\n",

      "Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments. The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are\n",

We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time. \"Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat.
